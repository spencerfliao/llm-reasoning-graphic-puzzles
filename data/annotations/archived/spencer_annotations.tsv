beb8660c.png	This task involves sorting and rearranging colored tiles based on their length. The non-black tiles from the input are organized from longest to shortest and are stacked at the bottom right of the output grid.	"The colored pixels from the longest contiguous horizontal block to the shortest in the input are rearranged into a vertical stack in the output, aligning to the bottom right."	"Colored blocks are identified by their lengths and rearranged such that the longest block is at the bottom and the shortest at the top, with all blocks right-aligned in the output grid."	"- `extract_color_blocks(input_grid)` to identify and extract the horizontal color blocks.
- `sort_blocks_by_length(color_blocks)` to sort these blocks by their length in descending order.
- `stack_and_align_blocks(sorted_blocks, output_grid_size)` to stack the sorted blocks at the bottom right of the output grid."	"The transformation involves sorting the colored blocks from the input by size and repositioning them into a vertical stack aligned to the right, starting from the bottom of the output grid."	"1. Extract the non-black horizontal blocks from the input using `extract_color_blocks(input_grid)`.
2. Sort the blocks by length with `sort_blocks_by_length(color_blocks)`.
3. Prepare an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
4. Align and stack the sorted blocks at the bottom right of the output grid using `stack_and_align_blocks(sorted_blocks, output_grid_size)`.
5. Ensure that the order of the stack reflects the descending order of block lengths.
6. Return the newly generated output grid."
c0f76784.png	"This task focuses on identifying empty boxes of varying sizes within the input grid and filling them with specific colors based on their dimensions. The boxes are defined by light grey borders and are filled in the output grid with blue, orange, or magenta, depending on the size of the empty space."	"For each detected empty box in the input:
3x3 empty spaces within 5x5 boxes are filled with blue pixels.
2x2 empty spaces within 4x4 boxes are filled with orange pixels.
1x1 empty spaces within 3x3 boxes are filled with magenta pixels."	"The objects of interest are the empty boxes, which are transformed by filling them with colored pixels. The transformation depends on the size of the box, with the color fill directly correlating to the size of the empty space inside the light grey borders."	"find_empty_boxes(input_grid) to locate all the empty boxes within the input grid.
determine_box_size(box) to determine the size of the empty space inside each box.
fill_box(box, size) to fill the box with the appropriate color based on the size."	"The overall pattern is to scan the input grid for empty boxes, categorize them by size, and then fill them with a designated color that corresponds to each size category."	"1. Use `find_empty_boxes(input_grid)` to get a list of all the empty boxes.
2. For each box, call `determine_box_size(box)` to get the size of the empty space.
3. Depending on the size, select the appropriate color: blue for 3x3, orange for 2x2, and magenta for 1x1.
4. Apply `fill_box(box, size)` to fill the empty space with the selected color.
5. Ensure that the fills do not overlap with the light grey borders of the boxes.
6. Return the modified output grid with all the boxes filled appropriately."
c1d99e64.png	"The task involves identifying lines of black pixels that span from one edge of the grid to the opposite edge, either horizontally or vertically, and filling these lines with red pixels to create the output."	"Black pixels that form a continuous line from one end of the grid to the other, without interruption, are changed to red pixels in the output."	"Lines, defined as uninterrupted sequences of black pixels that reach from one boundary of the grid to the opposite boundary, are the objects of interest that undergo a color change to red."	"- `find_continuous_lines(input_grid)` to detect all horizontal and vertical lines that span the entire grid.
- `fill_lines_with_color(lines, color)` to change the color of the identified lines to a specified color, in this case, red."	"The transformation pattern is characterized by the conversion of full-span black lines within the grid to red lines, while other pixels remain unchanged."	"1. Initialize an output grid that matches the size of the input grid.
2. Use `find_continuous_lines(input_grid)` to locate all the black lines that stretch from one end to the other of the grid.
3. Apply `fill_lines_with_color(lines, 'red')` to change the color of these lines to red in the output grid.
4. Ensure that only the lines that meet the end-to-end criterion are filled with red, and other black pixels do not change.
5. Return the modified output grid which now contains the red lines."
c3e719e8.png	"The task is to identify the most frequent color in the input grid and replicate the 3x3 grid in positions within the 9x9 output grid, at the positions where each of the single colored pixels filled the 3x3 input grid."	"In the input image of 3x3 pixels, identify the pixels of the color that has the most number of pixels. In the output of 9x9 pixels, treat each 3x3 block inside as a box, hence there are 3x3 boxes each with 3x3 pixels. Only fill the boxes with the input grid (and not just the color) where they are of the same position in relation to the output grid  as those most numbered colored pixels in the input grid are positioned in the 3x3 input grid)."	"The objects of interest are the individual 3x3 blocks within the 9x9 output grid. Each block corresponds to a specific position within the input grid. If a pixel of the most frequent color occupies a position in the input grid, that entire input grid pattern is replicated in the corresponding block of the output grid."	"- `find_most_frequent_color(input_grid)`: Identifies the color that occurs most frequently in the input grid.
- `replicate_pattern_in_output(output_grid, input_pattern, position)`: Replicates the 3x3 input grid pattern in the specified 3x3 block of the output grid.
- `initialize_output_grid(size, default_color)`: Creates an empty 9x9 output grid filled with the default background color."	The overall pattern involves creating a 9x9 output grid where each 3x3 block is filled with the pattern of the 3x3 input grid only if the position corresponds to the position of the most frequent color in the input grid. All other positions in the output grid remain the default background color.	"1. Initialize a 9x9 grid with the background color using `initialize_output_grid`.
2. Determine the most frequent color in the 3x3 input grid using `find_most_frequent_color`.
3. For each position in the 3x3 input grid that contains the most frequent color, replicate the entire 3x3 input grid in the corresponding block of the output grid using `replicate_pattern_in_output`.
4. Ensure that blocks in the output grid that do not correspond to the position of the most frequent color in the input grid are left with the background color.
5. Finalize the output grid with all the necessary 3x3 blocks filled accordingly."
c3f564a4.png	"This task involves identifying and filling in blacked-out areas within a colorful grid. The rest of the grid, which is not blacked out, consists of a repeating pattern of colors."	"The black pixels in the input grid are replaced with a continuation of the pattern present in the non-blacked-out portions of the grid, each pixel the same color as the one on its top-right or bottom-left."	The objects in question are the blacked-out areas within the grid. The goal is to replace these black areas with the correct sequence of colored pixels that would naturally continue the surrounding color pattern.	"- `get_objects(grid, multicolor=True)` to identify multicolored patterns within the grid.
- `fill_between_coords(grid, coord_1, coord_2, value)` to fill the blacked-out areas with the correct colors.
- `replace(grid, grid_1, grid_2)` to replace the black areas with a pattern grid.
- `get_pixel_coords(grid)` to determine the frequency and location of each color to assist in deducing the pattern."	The overall pattern requires deducing the sequence of colors in the grid and applying this sequence to the blacked-out areas such that the filled-in areas are indistinguishable from the surrounding pattern.	"1. Analyze the grid to understand the repeating color pattern.
2. Identify the blacked-out areas using `get_objects(grid, multicolor=True)` with the black color as the target.
3. Deduce the continuation of the color pattern for each black area.
4. Use `fill_between_coords` or `replace` to fill in the blacked-out areas with the deduced continuation of the color pattern.
5. Ensure that the pattern in the filled-in areas aligns correctly with the surrounding colored pixels.
6. Return the completed grid with the black areas filled in."
c8cbb738.png	The task identifies the maximum horizontal or vertical distances between pixels of the same color in the input grid to define the dimensions of squares in the output grid. The colored pixels from input are then centered while retaining their relative position to each other in the output grid that matches the background color of the input grid.	"Identify the background color of the input by the one having the most pixels, and fill the output with it. In the input there are scattered colored pixels, the furthest distance horizontally or vertically between the same colored pixels are the dimension of the square grid of output. taking each set of pixels of the same color and place them in the centre of the output grid and we get the final output"	"The task involves calculating the spread of similarly colored pixels within the input grid to determine the size of their corresponding square in the output grid. All unique color's spread is assessed, and the furthest distance between same-colored pixels, either horizontally or vertically, dictates the size of the square that color will occupy in the center of the output grid."	"get_background_color(grid) to determine the most common pixel value, which is assumed to be the background color.
calculate_color_spread(grid, color) to determine the maximum horizontal and vertical distances between pixels of the same color.
center_color_in_output(output_grid, color_pixels, square_size) to place the pixels of a particular color at the center of the output grid, maintaining their relative positions within a square of size determined by square_size."	"The pattern discerned from the input involves gathering all instances of the same color, finding the maximum spread in either direction, and creating a centralized square in the output grid that maintains the relative positions of these colored pixels within a uniformly colored background."	"1. Determine the background color of the input grid using `get_background_color`.
2. Initialize the output grid with the background color filling all cells.
3. For each unique color found in the input grid, calculate the size of the square it will occupy in the output grid using `calculate_color_spread`.
4. Center the colored pixels within their respective squares in the output grid using `center_color_in_output`.
5. Ensure that the squares are correctly centered within the output grid, maintaining the relative positions of the colored pixels as they appeared in the input grid."
c8f0f002.png	"This task replaces orange pixels in the input with dark grey in the output, while maintaining the positioning of all other colored pixels."	"In the input grid, orange pixels are directly transformed into dark grey pixels in the output grid. All other pixels retain their color and position from input to output."	"The objects, which can be defined as individual pixels or groups of pixels with the same color, undergo a simple transformation if they are orange, changing to dark grey. There is no change in the shape, size, or position of these objects other than the color transformation."	"- `replace(grid, grid_1, grid_2)`: This would be used to replace all occurrences of the orange color grid with a dark grey color grid.
- `get_objects(grid, by_color=True)`: This could initially identify all objects by color, which can then be used to selectively alter the orange objects.
- `change_object_color(obj, value)`: This function would change the color of the identified orange objects to dark grey."	"The input grid serves as a template where one specific color (orange) is targeted for a color swap to dark grey. All other elements of the grid remain unchanged, preserving the structure and distribution of other colors."	"1. Use `get_objects(input_grid, by_color=True)` to identify all color objects within the input grid.
2. For each object, if `get_object_color(obj)` returns orange, use `change_object_color(obj, dark_grey)` to alter the color.
3. Apply `replace` function to substitute orange pixels with dark grey in the input grid.
4. Return the modified grid as the output."
c9e6f938.png	"The task creates a mirrored version of the input grid and appending it to the right side of the original, effectively doubling the width of the grid."	"Each pixel in the input grid is duplicated and its mirrored copy is placed adjacent to the original on the right side. The mirror operation is horizontal, so the pixels are flipped over the vertical axis of the grid."	"Objects, which are clusters of similarly colored pixels, are mirrored as whole units. "	"- `horizontal_flip(grid)`: This function is used to generate the mirrored version of the input grid or objects within the grid.
- `combine_object(obj_1, obj_2)`: This function can be used to append the mirrored grid to the original grid."	"The overall pattern is the creation of a symmetric design where the input grid is mirrored horizontally and attached to the original grid's right side, forming a new grid that is twice as wide as the input grid."	"1. For each input grid:
   a. Generate a horizontal mirror image of the input grid using `horizontal_flip`.
   b. Append the flipped grid to the right side of the original grid using `combine_object`.
2. The output grid should now have the original grid on the left and its mirror image on the right."
c9f8e694.png	The task involves a color transformation process where each grey pixel in the input image is replaced with the color of the leftmost pixel in the same row.	"Grey pixels do not retain their original color; instead, they are recolored. The new color for each grey pixel is determined by identifying the leftmost non-grey pixel in the same row of the input grid and using its color."	"The objects, in this case, are individual pixels. The grey pixels are the targets for transformation, and their new color is sourced from the leftmost pixel of the corresponding row that is not grey."	"The key helper functions that would be used to execute this task are:
- `get_leftmost_pixel_color(row)`: Retrieves the color of the leftmost non-grey pixel in a given row.
- `replace_grey_pixels(input_grid)`: Iterates over the input grid, identifies grey pixels, and replaces them with the color returned by `get_leftmost_pixel_color`."	The pattern is characterized by a horizontal color replacement where the grey pixels in each row inherit their color from the leftmost non-grey pixel in that row. This process results in horizontal bands of color that correspond to the leftmost pixels' colors.	"1. Iterate through each row of the input grid.
2. For each grey pixel encountered, call `get_leftmost_pixel_color` for that row to find the color to replace with.
3. Replace the grey pixel with the color obtained from the leftmost non-grey pixel in the same row.
4. Repeat this process for all rows in the input grid to produce the output grid."
c59eb873.png	"The task requires scaling up the input grid by a factor of two, effectively quadrupling the number of pixels, with each pixel in the input represented by four identical pixels in the output."	"Each individual pixel from the input grid is transformed into a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid. This applies to all pixels, irrespective of their color or position."	"In the context of this task, an object is a single pixel from the input grid. The transformation process involves creating four duplicate pixels for every one pixel in the input, effectively turning single objects into larger objects of the same color without altering their relative positions."	"- `empty_grid(row, col)`: Generates an empty grid that is twice the height and width of the input grid.
- `fill_value(grid, pos, value)`: Fills the positions in the output grid that correspond to the enlarged pixel positions with their respective color values from the input grid."	"The pattern of the input grid is maintained, with each pixel simply becoming larger. The positions and colors of the pixels do not change relative to one another; they are merely represented on a larger scale."	"1. Initialize an output grid that is twice the height and width of the input grid using `empty_grid`.
2. Iterate over each pixel in the input grid.
3. For each pixel, determine the corresponding positions in the output grid and use `fill_value` to fill a 2x2 block with the color of the current input pixel.
4. Once all pixels from the input grid have been processed, return the output grid."
